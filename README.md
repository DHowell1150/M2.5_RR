# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:
* Questions:
1. spec/athletes/index_spec.rb it block line 13/29. Can I override 13 or simply comment out? 

2. do I need to model test self.college_athlete? 

* Must go back to
  - boolean in show and index_spec for updating form (show: 54, 18)
  index: 44, 56
  gym_athlete index_spec: 54

* Refactor wish list
  - If statement in view for model boolean method US3
  - US6 appear before.  Is this correct? It seems to know when it's created as to how it's ordered in my `before` block, not necessarily `created_at`
